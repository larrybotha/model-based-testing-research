## Purpose

Learn how to use model-based testing in day-to-day developoment in order to
write applications that are robust, in shorter periods of time, that respond to
change more effectively than applications written without an MBT approach.

## Goals

- understand how to use state charts and finite state machines on the frontend
    and in the backend
- understand how to generate tests from models
- understand how to combine property-based testing with model-based testing

## Research
